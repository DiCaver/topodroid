<h3>TopoDroid QUICK GUIDE</h3>

This page covers the basics of TopoDroid. Refer to the user manual for more details.<br><p>

<b>[1] Pair the device with Android</b><br>
The device must be paired with the Android. This should be done also for bluetooth Low-Energy devices (SAP5, BRIC4).
Do that with the "Settings" app. Go to "network | bluetooth", turn the device on, and scan for devices. Your device should be found. Select it and enter the PIN "0000" (four zeros) to pair it with Android if asked to.
If your device repeatedly asks the pin, set the socket to "insecure" in TopoDroid settings.<br><p>

<b>[2] Select the device in TopoDroid</b><br>
Start TopoDroid. To tell it to work with your device, tap the <i>Device</i> button. The name and address of your device should appear in the list. To select it tap its address, so that it appears in the top row.<br><p>

<b>[3] Calibrate the device</b><br>
If your device is not calibrated, you need to calibrate it. 
For the DistoX this can be done with TopoDroid: refer to the user manual.<br>
For the SAP5 and the BRIC4 this is done by the device, with no need of TopoDroid.<p>
