<h4>SURVEY IMPORT</h4>

This dialog is opened from the <i>Import</i> button in the <u>main window</u>.<br><p>

It displays the list of zip archives in the app zip folder.<br><p>

If the survey name of the file to import already exists in the database the file is not imported.<br><p>

<b>N.B.</b>
Import may fail (and crash the app) due to failure on the database that TopoDroid cannot intercept.
If this happens delete the partially imported survey and retry to import it.<br><p>
