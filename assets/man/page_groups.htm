<h4>DistoX CALIBRATION DATA GROUPS</h4>

This dialog is opened from the <i>Group</i> button of the <u>calibration data window</u>.<br><p>

Before computing the calibration coefficients the calibration data must be subdivided in groups of data having the same azimuth and inclination (but different roll).<br><p>

The groups are identified by an integer number starting with 1.<br>
A data with number 0 is listed but excluded from the coefficients computation.<br>
<!-- "Deleted" data have group number -1. --><br><p>  

You can assign the group number to each calibration data by hand (with the <i>Calibration data edit</i> dialog),
or let TopoDroid assign the group numbers for you.
There are two automatic group assignment policies:
<ol>
<li><i>TopoDroid</i>: four data at a time for each group;</li>
<li><i>PocketTopo</i>: four-at-a-time for the first 16 data (four groups), then each data is a group by itself;</li>
<!-- li>groups based on the relative angle distance (direction difference).</li -->
</ol>
<br><p>

Actions:
<ul>
<li><i>Reset groups</i>: all the data groups are reset</li> 
<li><i>OK</i>: groups are assigned (only to non-deleted data without a group)</li>
</ul>
<br><p>
