TopoDroid is an Android app for cave surveying. TopoDroid takes the raw data, helps you to organize them, and produces the line map of the survey on the spot. You can further draw sketches around the line map while you are surveying, thereby reducing the probability of error entering in your sketch, and helping you to detect errors in the data while you are still in the cave. TopoDroid has many functions to help you get the most out of your work in the cave. In this way a working map is almost ready as you are ending the survey trip.<br><p>

TopoDroid makes the time you spend surveying in the cave more effective. It is designed to handle a survey at a time, not to manage complex cave survey projects that include several different surveys.
This is because the purpose of TopoDroid is to help a surveyor to collect the data with more accuracy as well as to make the surveying
task more pleasant, not to produce the final map of the cave. For that purpose good PC programs already exist.<br><p>

Nevertheless TopoDroid includes a <i>Cave project Manager</i> that can be used to compose surveys into a cave/karst project.<br><p>

TopoDroid is specifically designed to work with the DistoX, SAP5, and BRIC4. However, survey data can be manually entered.<br><p>

By default TopoDroid has unspecified  screen orientation, but it can be fixed to portrait or landscape through a global setting.<br><p>

<h4>Errors and crashes</h4>
Due to limited resources, the apk cannot be fully tested. It is advisable to install TopoDroid updates with an apk-manager that keeps the apk of previously installed versions. By this means you can safely revert to a version you are comfortable with, in case you find problems with the latest apk. Do not forget to report your problems so that they will be taken into account in the next version. Bug-reports are promptly considered, and the app is frequently updated.
