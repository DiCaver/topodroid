TopoDroid is an Android app for cave surveying. TopoDroid takes the raw data, helps you to organize them, and produces the line map of the survey on the spot. You can further draw sketches around the line map while you are surveying, thereby reducing the probability of error entering in your sketch, and helping you to detect errors in the data while you are still in the cave. TopoDroid has many functions to help you get the most out of your work in the cave. In this way a working map is almost ready as you are ending the survey trip.
<br><p>

TopoDroid makes the time you spend surveying in the cave more effective.
The purpose of TopoDroid is to help a surveyor to collect the data with more accuracy as well as to make the surveying
task more pleasant, not to produce the final map of the cave. For that purpose good PC programs already exist.<br><p>

TopoDroid has five different "activity levels". The lowest levels already have
enough functionalities to download data, manage station names, and draw simple sketches.
The higher levels can be used to prepare data and sketches for an easier work on the PC.<br><p>

TopoDroid is designed to handle a survey at a time, not to manage complex cave survey projects that include several different surveys.
Nevertheless it includes a <i>Cave Project Manager</i>, that can be used to compose surveys into a cave/karst project,
and a <i>3D Viewer</i>, with which you can see the 3D of surveys and cave projects.<br><p>

TopoDroid works with DistoX, Sap5, and Bric4. However, survey data can be manually entered.<br>
Beware that Android devices (and active stilus) can influence the measurements taken with an electronic device, if they are too close.<br><p>
