<h4>DistoX DATA DOWNLOAD</h4>

The <i>Download</i> button starts a connection with the DistoX to download data.
While the connection is active it stays red. If you are using the <i>on-demand</i> download-mode the connection is closed when there are no more data to retrieve.
With the <i>continuous</i> download-mode the connection remains open (and data are continuously downloaded as soon as they are taken)
until the DistoX and the Android lose the Bluetooth connection.  Which mode is best suited for you depends on your habits.
With the <i>on-demand</i> mode you can concentrate on sketching and other tasks without being bothered by incoming data, and when you download the data
you can focus on them (they are highlighted blue). On the other hand <i>on-demand</i> download requires pauses to get the data,
and these are especially long if you took several shots in the between.<br><p>

When the Bluetooth connection with the DistoX is broken (eg. the DistoX gets too far from the Android, or it is switched off)
in <i>on-demand</i> mode, the data download is interrupted.
In <i>continuous</i> mode TopoDroid retries to connect to the DistoX every few seconds.<br><p>

When the survey <u>data window</u> is closed the data download connection is terminated. The download connection is not interrupted when the
window is paused (the display switches off). If you open a sketch while the download connection is active in <i>continuous</i> mode,
the connection is maintained and the data are downloaded (and displayed in the sketch).<br><p>

For the <i>SAP5</i> only the <i>continuous</i> data download mode is possible.<br><p>
