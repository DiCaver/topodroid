<h4>LIST AND GRID TOOL PICKER</h4>

This dialog is used to select the current drawing tool.<br>
It is opened with a longtap on the <i>Tools</i> button in the <u>sketch window</u> (in "drawing" mode),
or with the rightmost button (with double-arrow) in the bottom toolbar.<br><p>

The "triple grid" layout displays all the types at the same time.
The "list" and "grid" layouts have three tabs at the top, <b>Point, Line, Area</b> to switch among the three types of tools.<br><p>

The dialog displays the tools of the selected type,
<ul>
<li>either as a <b>list</b>, with a selection checkbox, tool icon and name [default]</li>
<li>or a as a <b>grid</b> with the tool icons</li>
<li>or a as a <b>triple grid</b> (points, lines and areas) with the tool icons</li>
</ul>

To select a tool
<ul>
<li>check its box in the list, and close the dialog (Back key)</li>
<li>tap its icon in the grid, and close the dialog</li>
</ul>
<br>
A shortcut for these is a double-tap on the check-box or the icon.<br><p>


The <b>Slider</b> sets icon orientation (orientable point tools, and area tools).<br><p>

The <b>+/-</b> button changes the (global) default icon size cycling through XS, S, M, L, XL.<br><p>

When canvas views [G] are enabled and the selected tool is associated only to disabled views,
it is replaced by the corresponding "user" tool.
