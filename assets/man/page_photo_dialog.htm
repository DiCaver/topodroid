<b>TopoDroid camera</b><br>
This is a simple implementation of a camera. 
Its unique feature is that it stores the azimuth and inclination of the device in exif tags in the image file. 
The azimuth is stored as GPS_LONGITUDE and the inclination as GPS_LATITUDE (with sign).
<br>
The following exif tags are set by TopoDroid:
<ul>
<li><i>Software</i>: "TopoDroid" and its version, separated by a space</li>
<li><i>Orientation</i>:</li>
<li><i>Datatime</i>: timestamp</li>
<li><i>GPS latitude</i>: inclination</li>
<li><i>GPS latitude ref</i>: "N" or "S"</li>
<li><i>GPS longitude</i>: azimuth</li>
<li><i>GPS longitude ref</i>: "E"</li>
<li><i>Image description</i>: azimuth and inclination in 1/100&deg;, separaated by a space</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

For "photo" point or photo xsection the display of te TopoDroid camera has a centered overlaid cross-hair.<br><p>

The TopoDroid camera has three buttons on the lower right.
<ul>
<li><b>camera</b>. Red: ready, tap to take a picture. Blue: on hold, tap to turn camera active.</li>
<li><b>save</b> saves the picture</li>
<li><b>back</b> closes the window</li>
</ul>

With the screen up the picture is portrait.
When the screen is turned to the left or to the rigth the picture is landscape.<br><p>

Zoom buttns are brought up by tapping the screen in the mid-bottom.
To go through large zoom steps tap the zoom buttons repeatedly fast.
