The shot flags, "duplicate", "surface" and "commented", are mutually exclusive.
Shots with a flag do not count for the survey statistics.
The export of the shot is also affected by the shot flag, either with a flag, if the format supports it, or as comment.<br><p>

<b>Station cut-n-paste</b><br>
Station names can be 'cut', 'copied', and 'pasted' across the app, in any dialog where there is a station entry
field.<br><p>

Long-tapping the station entry field opens the drop-down menu with the three options
<ul>
<li>cut</li>
<li>copy</li>
<li>paste</li>
</ul>
