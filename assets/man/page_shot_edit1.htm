 for downloaded shots</li>
<li>differences of acceleration, magnetic field, and magnetic dip from the respective average values. Only for DistoX2 shots</li>
<li><b>stations</b></li>
<li><b>left arrow</b>: load previous leg</li>
<li><b>reverse</b>: swap stations</li>
<li><b>right arrow</b>: load next leg</li>
<li>shot <b>comment</b></li>
<li>profile "extend" choice: "left", "vertical", "right". "Unset" if none is checked</li>
</ul><br><p>

Buttons:
<ul>
<li><img src="btn_duplicate.png" > "duplicate" flag</li>
<li><img src="btn_surface.png" > "surface" flag</li>
<li><img src="btn_comment.png" > "commented" flag</li>
<li><img src="btn_leg_after.png" > the shot belongs to the immediately preceding leg.</li>
<li><img src="btn_leg_before.png" > the shot belongs to the immediately following leg.</li>
<li><img src="btn_backleg.png" > the shot is a backsight leg.</li>
<li><img src="btn_renumber.png" > renumber shots from this leg onward following the current station naming policy. Both stations must have been specified</li>
<li><img src="btn_splay_group.png" > apply the station change to all splays in the group of the splay shot. It applies only to the splays with same station as the edit shot.
Only FROM station must have been specified. (A group of splays is the set of splays between two legs)</li>
<li><img src="btn_plan_profile.png" > restricts the display of splays to plan only or to profile only or both</li>
<li><img src="btn_xsplay.png" > clear (or set) splay class for this splay, and possibly the previous splays.</li>
<li><b>OK</b>: save the changes and close the dialog</li>
<li><b>Save</b>: save the changes without closing the dialog</li>
<li><b>More</b>: switch to the secondary <a href="page_shot_edit2.htm">edit dialog</a></li>
<li><b>Cancel</b>: close the dialog without saving</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

The shot flags, "duplicate", "surface" and "commented", are mutually exclusive.
Shots with a flag do not count for the survey statistics.
The export of the shot is also affected by the shot flag, either with a flag, if the format supports it, or as comment.<br><p>

<b>Station cut-n-paste</b><br>
Station names can be 'cut', 'copied', and 'pasted' across the app, in any dialog where there is a station entry
field.<br><p>

Long-tapping the station entry field opens the drop-down menu with the three options
<ul>
<li>cut</li>
<li>copy</li>
<li>paste</li>
</ul>

<b>Splay classes</b><br>
Splay classes are enabled with a "custom setting". There are four classes:
<ul>
<li><i>normal</i>, generic, splays. Blue</li>
<li><i>x-section</i> splays. Green</li>
<li><i>horizontal</i>, plan-view, splays. Dark blue</li>
<li><i>vertical</i>, profile-view, splays. Violet</li>
</ul>

Splay claases are set with the multiselection "special actions" button.<br>
In multiselection you can select more splays and assign them all a splay class.<br>
If you want to set the class for a large number of splays, it is more convenient to assign the class
to the first and the last (with multiselection), and set it to all the splays in between with the
shot edit dialog. If you open the dialog to edit the last splay, there is a button with a cross of the 
same color of the splay class.<br>
If the "all splays" button is checked, when you "save" all the previous "normal" splays
are set to the splay class.<br><p>

If you tap the button it turns to the color of normal splays and upon "save" the splay cahnges to "normal".
It the "all splays" button is checked, all the contiguous previous splays of the same class are turned to
"normal".<br><p>
