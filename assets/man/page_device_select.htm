<h4>DistoX DEVICE SELECT</h4>

TopoDroid supports the following device:
<ul>
<li>DistoX (first version)</li>
<li>DistoX2 (second version)</li>
<li>SAP5 (Shetland Attack Pony), only models with bluetooth [T]</li>
<LI>BRIC [T]</li>
</ul>

All devices must be paired with the Android.<br><p>

Normally TopoDroid works with only one device. 
The data can be downloaded continuously (<i>continuous</i> mode) or in batch (<i>on-demand</i> mode).
The difference between the two modes is that the <i>continuous</i> mode remains active when the data download
is finished, or the connection with the device is lost, while the <i>on-demand</i> mode is closed. <br>
SAP5 and BRIC download the data only in continuous mode.<br><p>

With DistoX's TopoDroid can work with more than one device at once, although 
the data are still downloaded from only one device at a tine.<br>
The <i>data download mode</i> must be set to <i>multi</i>.
When it is so a long-tap on the <i>download</i> button brings up a dialog to choose from which DistoX to download the data.<br><p>
