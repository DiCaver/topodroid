<h4>DEVICE SELECT</h4>

TopoDroid supports the following device:
<ul>
<li>DistoX (first version)</li>
<li>DistoX2 (second version)</li>
<li>SAP5 (Shetland Attack Pony), only models with bluetooth [T]</li>
<LI>BRIC4 [T]</li>
</ul>

All devices must be paired with the Android.<br><p>

Normally TopoDroid works with only one device. 
The data can be downloaded continuously (<i>continuous</i> mode) or in batch (<i>on-demand</i> mode).
The difference between the two modes is that the <i>continuous</i> mode remains active when the data download
is finished, or the connection with the device is lost, while the <i>on-demand</i> mode is closed. <br><p>

SAP5 and BRIC download the data only in continuous mode.<br><p>

With DistoX's TopoDroid can work with more than one device at once, although 
the data are still downloaded from only one device at a tine.<br>
The <i>data download mode</i> must be set to <i>multi</i>.
When it is so a long-tap on the <i>download</i> button brings up a dialog to choose from which DistoX to download the data.<br><p>

<b>Shetland Attack Pony</b><br>

TopoDroid supports the model of the Shetland Attack Pony, version 5 (SAP5), with bluetooth.<br>
The device must have been previously "paired" with Android, using the <i>Settings</i> app.
The PIN is "000000" (six zeros).<br>
Afterward the SAP is listed among the known devices in the <i>Device Window</i>.
It appears as "SAP XX MAC-address", where "XX" is the two-letter code of the SAP, for example "HG".<br>
To select the SAP as current device tap on the its entry in the list.<br><p> 

While connected, the SAP5 will transfer the reading of a shot values to the app, whether or not the shot data
are stored or discarded on the device.<br>
If not connected the values are not transferred to the app.<br>
Upon reconnection the SAP5 does <u>not</u> transfer the shot data stored while not connected.<br><p>

The SAP keeps in its internal memory the data that have been "stored".
These can be retrieved as a Survex file, using the SAP PonyTrainer program.<br><p>

The calibration of the SAP5 is done by the device and does not require an external program.<br><p> 

<b>BRIC4</b><br>

TopoDroid supports the BRIC version 4.<br>
The device must have been previously "paired" with Android, using the <i>Settings</i> app.<br>
Afterward the BRIC is listed among the known devices in the <i>Device Window</i>.
It appears as "BRIC code MAC-address", where the code is the four-digit code of the BRIC, for example "0039".<br>
To select the BRIC as current device tap on the its entry in the list.<br><p> 

Once connected to a client, the BRIC remembers the connection, even if turned off, therefore it stays
"always connected".<br>
When TopoDroid is connected, shot readings are immediately transferred to the app.
If TopoDroid is not connected, the data are kept in memory, and transferred to the app when it is
next connected.<br><p>

The BRIC stores the data in internal memory in CSV files. If connected to a PC via USB, the device
appears as external memory and the CSV files can be copied to the PC.<br><p>

The calibration of the BRIC4 is done by the device and does not require an external program.<br><p> 

The BRIC4 can be controlled from the app. In particular it is possible to turn the laser on/off, and to take
shots. The BRIC4 has also a "scan mode" in which readings are taken continuosly, about two every second.<br><p>
