<h4>Fractal Analysis</h4>

The fractal analysis considers the 3D space divided into cubes and counts the number of cubes
that cover the cave (midline and splays).
For a 3-dimensional object, when the cube side halves, i.e. is divided by 2,
the number of cubes that cover the cave increase by 8 = 2<sup>3</sup>.
The fractal exponent at a given side is the power of 2 (ie, 3 in the example).<br><p>

The fractal analysis finds this exponent for varying length of the cube side,
and displays the result as a graph.<br><p>
