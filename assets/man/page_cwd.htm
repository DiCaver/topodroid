<h4>WORK DIRECTORY</h4>

TopoDroid does not manage complex cave survey projects. However it is possible to specify a different work directory (folder) for the data files.
The base folder of the TopoDroid folder is the primary external memory (/sdcard) for Android up to v. 10, 
and the public folder (/sdcard/Documents) since Android 11.
Up to Android 10 the "base folder" can be changed [T].<br><p>

Each work folder is a subfolder of the "base folder", and it is created if it does not exists. The name of the current work folder must begin with "TopoDroid". If you specify a name not beginning with "TopoDroid", it will be prepended automatically.<br><p>

The drawing symbol files and the files related to the devices (database, firmware, memory dumps, calibrations) are installed only in the default folder "TopoDroid". The other current work folder contain only the survey database and survey-related files.<br><p>

You can use different folders, named "topoDroid-Cave", for different cave survey projects, and switch to the one you need.<br>
Alternatively you can have a "TopoDroid" folder for each project and switch to the one you must work on when you need by renaming folders with a file manager. In this way the common utility files are replicated in each folder. It may be useful if you have different drawing tools for each project.<br><p>

The choice of the current work folder is one of the general settings of the app in the <u>main window</u>.<br><p>
