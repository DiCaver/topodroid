<h4>TopoDroid WORK DIRECTORY</h4>

<div style="font-size=90%">
In order to manage cave survey projects involving several survey sessions, it is advisable to use a specific work directory (folder) for each cave project.<br>
The name of any work dircetory must begin with "TopoDroid" (case independent).<br>
The work directories are created inside TopoDroid base foldee "Documents/TDX".<br><p>

The drawing symbol files and the files related to the devices (database, firmware, memory dumps, calibrations) are stored only in the
app private "files" folder (in the external storage). The work folders contain only the survey database and survey folders.<br><p>

The choice of the current work folder is one of the general settings of the app in the <u>main window</u>.
