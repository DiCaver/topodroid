<h4>WORK DIRECTORY</h4>

<div style="font-size=90%">
TopoDroid does not manage complex cave survey projects. However it is possible to specify a different work directory (folder) for the data files.
The base folder of the TopoDroid folders is the app private "files" directory.<br><p> 

Each work folder is a subfolder, and it is created if it does not exists. The name of the current work folder must begin with "TopoDroid". If you specify a name not beginning with "TopoDroid", it will be prepended automatically.<br><p>

The drawing symbol files and the files related to the devices (database, firmware, memory dumps, calibrations) are stored only in the "files" folder. The work folders contain only the survey database and survey folders.<br><p>

You can use different folders, named "topoDroid-Cave", for different cave survey projects, and switch to the one you need.<br>
Alternatively you can have a "TopoDroid" folder for each project and switch to the one you must work on when you need by renaming
folders with a file manager.<br><p>

The choice of the current work folder is one of the general settings of the app in the <u>main window</u>.
