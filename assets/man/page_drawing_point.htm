<h4>SKETCH POINT</h4>

This dialog is opened when you select a point symbol and tap the
<i>Edit</i> button in the <u>sketch window</u> (in "edit" mode).<br><p>

Point properties:
<ul>
<li><b>size</b> (XS, S, M, L, XL)</li>
<li><b>orientation</b>, if the point is orientable</li>
<li><b>layers</b>, the canvas views on which the point is displayed [T]</li>
<li><b>text</b>, if the point has text associated</li>
<li>additional Therion <b>options</b></li>
<li><b>x-section</b> checkbox to display the xsection outline ("section" points only)</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

The canvas views are presented as checkboxes with the view letter-code. You can change the views the point belongs to.
The point icon is not displayed if all its views are OFF.
The selectable point will nevertheless be shown in edit mode, so that the point edit dialog remains accessible.
<br><p>

<b>Save</b> confirms the changes and closes the dialog.<br><p>

"Section" points have also the <b>Sketch</b> button to open the sketch, if it exists.
Changes to the xsections are not propagated to the outline in the sketch: to update it,
close the outline and open it again.
<br><p>

With <i>side-drag</i> enabled, the point orientation can be changed also by sliding up and down on the left and right sides of the canvas.<br><p>

The <i>BACK</i> key closes the dialog without saving the changes.<br><p>
