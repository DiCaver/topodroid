<h4>TopoDroid LOGGING</h4>

<div style="font-size=90%">
Logging is important to solve problems when the program does not behave as expected. For example when the outcome of a computation does not agree with that obtained by other means, or a user input is not properly parsed. There are several log-flags to limit the logs to those necessary to find the cause of the problem. By default only "error" (i.e., when the program detects something that should not have happened) are logged.<br><p>

Logs [E] are different from software crashes. Crashes are due to the program misbehaving in the system, and are detected by the system, that ends the program. You should report crashes (and ANR) via Google Play so that a stack trace is attached and they can be fixed more easily.<br>

Refer to TopoDroid website for how to have crashes and ANR reported.<br><p>
