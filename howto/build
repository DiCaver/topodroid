Howto Build with ant

[0] Java version is set with JAVA_HOME environment
# export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/jre-11.0.12
export JAVA_HOME=/home/programs/android-studio/jre

[1] Android setup:
/home/programs/android-sdk : all android stuff
/home/programs/android-ndk : all android NDK stuff

[2] Topodroid setup.

Home:
/home/programs/android-sdk/sample/android-8/topodroid

It contains
AndroidManifest.xml, res, src, jni, assets, libs, symbols-git, other dirs
build.xml, proguard.cfg, project.properties, make_symbols.sh

It also has subdir ant with
build.properties, local.properties

Notes.
Translations are symlinks in res to subdirs in int18.
Icons are symlinks in res to subdir in drawable.
Symbols are in symbols-git and make_symbol.sh creates the zips
Subdirs bin gen are created by the build

More notes
src used to have androidx linking ../aosp/androidx, but it is not necessary

[3] TopoDroid debug build.
   ant debug
or 
   make
   
[4] TopoDroid debug install.
   adb install -r bin/DistoX-debug.apk
or
   make install
   
N.B. to build/install release apk replace "debug" with "release".
Keystore and key for topodroid are not included in the repo :-)

[5] TopoDroid release build
   make release
This is however not suitable for install on newer Androids. 
Therefore use
   make signed
which creates a v1-3 signed apk.

Next get size and md5
   make md5
   [] upload the signed apk to speleoapks
   mv Topodroid-... APKS
cd ../speleoapks and git push
