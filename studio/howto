How to build TopoDroid-X with Android Studio

[1] create an empty Studio project with name com.topodroid.TDX

[2] copy the src/com/topodroid folder to app/src/main/java/com/topodroid

[3] copy the res/* subfolders to app/src/main/res

[4] copy the folder assets to app/src/main

[5] copy the folder libs to app/src/main or maybe to app

[5] copy AndroidManifest to app/src/main

[6] edit app/build.gradle:
  - remove all dependencies
  - remove testInstrumentationRunner
  - change minSdk to 18
  - change targetSdk to 29
  - set applicationId to com.topodroid.TDX

[7] in Gradle,scripts/gradle.properties
  android.useAndroidX=false

[8] in the run start the activity com.topodroid.TDX.MainWindow

[9] to include native libs - in build.gradle
  externalNativeBuild {
    ndkBuild {
      path="/path/to/Android.mk"
    }
  }
  however there are problems ... it would be nice to link the libs already compiled
